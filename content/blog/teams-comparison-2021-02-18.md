Comparing work environments I had in my professional life, I can say for sure that some were better, and others were worse. Here I look from a macro level - teams, projects and management.

By  management I mean the person directly above the team, an engineering manager or a chief officer. "Good management" means someone who is at least open to dialog, gives autonomy to the team, and keeps a proper distance. "Bad management" is an unpredictable or emotionally unstable person, with lack of feedback and lack of dialog.

So this is the rating, from the best experience to the worst:

  1. One team working on one project, good management;
  2. Two teams working on one project, good management;
  3. Many teams working on many projects, good management;
  4. One team working on many projects, okay management;
  5. Working on one project alone, with some colleagues assigned to help, okay management;
  6. Many teams working on one project, bad management.

### Don't motivate people, remove what demotivates them

What demotivates:

1. I had once a truly bad engineering manager, and CTO wasn't much better. This was the worst environment I had ever worked at. When you can't have a dialog with your management, when you have to deal with blame and lies every day, software development goes to the second place. Your main goal is to survive, to protect yourself and your team members, and to fight back. This is not how you become a better developer. 

In the top three places I had very good teamleads/engineering managers. They were truly interested in the work we did, and they never put their interests before anyone else's interests. We achieved a lot, and the team spirit was high.

2. Next in importance is many teams working on a single project - that's what drags #2, #3 and #6 down.

Almost every good developer I know wants to do a good job - write high-quality code, deliver no bugs, make customers happy. If there were exceptions, I can count them with the fingers on one hand.

When several teams work on the same codebase without any boundaries, they begin to break each others code. What you wrote yesterday will be broken tomorrow by somebody else. In such environment you don't see a point in making a good design, maintaining and improving it. Unless a team has a full responsibily over a certain part of a codebase - it's just hacking and putting patches over patches.

3. Finally, one team working on many projects - it's not that terrible, just a bit harder to keep focus. But in general, to deliver a good product you need to understand its value, its purpose. Many different projects - each of them feels like "just another thing".



### Mastery, autonomy and purpose

Incindentally, the three points kind match the drivers for intrinsic motivation from "Drive" by. The three drivers are autonomy, mastery and purpose. The match might be not that straightforward, but in general: good management gives you autonomy, single project gives you the purpose, and responsibility for the project opens the way to mastery.
