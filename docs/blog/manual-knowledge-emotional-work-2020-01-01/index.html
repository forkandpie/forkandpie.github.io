    <p class="is-size-3">Manual Work, Knowledge Work and Emotional Work</p>
    <p class="is-italic"></p>
    <br/>
    <p>So this is a product of two readings I’m doing now — “Wardley Maps” book and research on knowledge work.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps">“Wardley Maps”</a> is a book published on Medium by Simon Wardley. In the book, Mr. Wardley describes his research on strategy in business, a discovery of laws of evolution in business and a special mapping system he created. In chapter 10, he notes that on a macro-scale, the processes of evolution apply to change of Ages — Mechanical Age, Age of Electricity, Age of Internet.</p>
<p>In parallel, I’ve started researching the theory of Knowledge Work. I’ve found a great article <a href="https://www.nickols.us/shift_to_KW.htm">“The Shift from Manual Work to Knowledge Work”</a> by Fred Nickols, that describes very well the properties of the Knowledge Work. In Manual Work, producing means processing materials, so I’ll use the names “Material Work” and “Manual Work” interchangeably. In Knowledge Work, we process knowledge.</p>
<p>What if we assumed that Material Work and Knowledge Work were also two consequent waves of evolution? Looking at software development, I came to a couple of interesting conclusions:</p>
<h3 id="1-we-are-still-using-material-work-tools-and-ideas-in-knowledge-work">1. We are still using Material Work tools and ideas in Knowledge Work</h3>
<p>The most common software management methodologies — Kanban, Lean, and Six Sigma — were initially designed for manufacturing. They aim to reduce waiting time, waste and number of defects.
Manufacturing deals with materials, where waiting for components can block the production line, material waste is easy to measure, and the percentage of defective products is easy to count. None of this is natural for software products.</p>
<p>To apply Kanban, we have a sort of cargo cult of tickets on Kanban boards to imitate waiting of material components. All tickets look the same, so we use story points to depict their sizes. At the same time, each ticket is unique, takes unpredictable time to deliver, they often appear unpredictably, so overall tickets are hard to plan. On the good side, waiting for a software component is not as strict as in the material world. We can develop to API agreement, for test cases, we can develop without specification for MVP. It greatly depends on how much we trust our colleagues and management.</p>
<p>Some concepts of Lean apply to Software development: if we squint hard enough, we can say that “Overproduction” and “Over-processing” mean doing work that won’t be used. Taking notice of Muri — overburden of employees — is important in knowledge work. But transportation, waiting, moving and over-stocking — they are not natural.</p>
<p>Six Sigma deals with the number of defects in a batch of manufactured products. We may say that we can use the number of bug tickets instead. But in reality, a software product with hundred of bugs can be a business success, while a small typo in another product can ruin a business (I witnessed both). Counting metrics are generally hard to apply to software development evaluation — the number of tickets, bugs, commits, lines of code, hours spent — they don’t really reflect the work done.</p>
<p>I am not saying that these methods are useless. They help us while we are adjusting and coming up with something more appropriate. They use intuitively familiar concepts. They offer at least something. But they will become outdated, as they are don’t describe the processes and the product of Knowledge Work.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-next-evolutionary-wave-could-be-emotional-intelligence">2. The next evolutionary wave could be Emotional Intelligence</h3>
<p>In the Age of Material Work ‘blue collars’ work with materials — like assembling, soldering, construction building, electrical wiring. ‘White collars’ work with knowledge — making calculations, designing buildings and circuits, creating instructions and training courses to help ‘blue collars’ get better at their job. The knowledge work drives the success of material work.</p>
<p>Now in the Age of Knowledge Work ‘blue collars’ work with knowledge — software engineers, medical workers, legal workers. What drives successful knowledge work? My answer is “soft skills”. Companies already invest in training managers and team leaders in topics like conflict resolution, motivation, trust, communication. I believe that emotional intelligence is a basis of soft skills, and I want to write more on this later.</p>
<p>This next argument might be a little far-fetched but stick with me. We observe the movement for ‘social justice’ that is gaining power over the last few years. Just like several decades ago, women and people of color were fighting for their right for education; now they are fighting for their right for equal treatment and opportunities. You may like it or not, but it looks pretty logical to me when I think about the growing importance of emotional work.</p>
<p>We are not getting better as software engineers by learning and applying the methods of Material Work. Kent Beck mentioned on some podcast his coaching work at Facebook. He expected it to be about software development practices, but it turned out to be mostly about communication. Recently I’ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhl-xrN9Hmk">this talk by Meri Williams</a>, a current CTO of Monzo and a host of The Lead Developer conference. She starts with Monoliths and Microservices, but then she quickly goes into the human side of software engineering: don’t fight your colleagues, think about shared goals, step into their shoes, gain their trust, build connections. We are getting better at creating software by focusing on the human side of Knowledge Work — improving communication, acknowledging feelings, building relationships. These are the keys to efficiency and reliability in Knowledge Work.</p>
<p>Could it be that in 20–30 years we will have Emotional Workers everywhere? What would drive their success?</p>
